# Capstone Project Proposal  
**Title:** Global Learning Equity, Creative Thinking & Achievement  
**Author:** Yvan Bayingana  
**Sector:** Education

---

## 1. Problem Description

Despite steady global improvements in academic scores, **equity gaps—by socio‑economic status and gender—remain** across school systems._PISA 2022 introduced a creative thinking assessment and documented disparities by SES and gender; TIMSS 2023 similarly underscored growing gender differences and home‑resource gaps. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

This capstone seeks to analyze how academic performance (math, science, reading) and creative thinking vary by these dimensions in **64 global systems**.

## 2. Research Questions & Objectives

### RQ1: How do mean scores vary by gender and SES across countries?
- **Obj 1a:** Calculate country-level averages and gap estimates
- **Obj 1b:** Visualise score distributions by subgroup (violin/boxplots)

### RQ2: How do home, school, and teacher resources predict performance?
- **Obj 2a:** Fit multilevel regression models
- **Obj 2b:** Rank variables by predictive strength (e.g. home books, teacher degree)

### RQ3: Which systems pair high achievement with narrow equity gaps?
- **Obj 3a:** Perform cluster analysis on countries based on equity-performance profiles
- **Obj 3b:** Use dashboards to explore these profiles interactively

---

## 3. Data & Methodology

- **PISA 2022** (public use): includes scores in creative thinking and core domains with SES and gender data. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
- **TIMSS 2023** (public use): includes Grades 4 & 8 math and science scores, plus student, parent, teacher and school questionnaires. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}

### Key Steps:
1. Convert SAS/SPSS files to CSV using Python scripts  
2. Average plausible values and standardise ESCS or home-resource indexes  
3. Respect weighting, stratification, and replicate rules for both PISA and TIMSS  
4. Harmonise variable definitions (e.g. gender, SES quintiles) across datasets  
5. Apply multilevel models and clustering on aggregated country profiles

## 4. Expected Deliverables

- Cleaned, harmonized PISA + TIMSS datasets  
- Jupyter notebooks for initial exploration and regression analysis  
- Interactive Power BI Power BI dashboards (.pbix and data exports)  
- Written report interpreting results within educational equity frameworks  
- Final GitHub repository with full documentation and visual assets

## 5. Timeline

| Weeks     | Activities                                 |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1–2       | Literature review & data acquisition       |
| 3–4       | Cleaning, variable alignment & weighting   |
| 5–6       | Descriptive analysis & gap visualisation   |
| 7–8       | Modeling and cluster analysis              |
| 9–10      | Dashboard construction                     |
| Final     | Summary report writing & repo finalisation |

## 6. Limitations & Ethical Considerations

- Cross-sectional design does not allow causal inference  
- Sub-national benchmarking systems (e.g. Hong Kong, Quebec) may be excluded as needed  
- All datasets are anonymised; ensure privacy and data sensitivity are respected

---

## 7. Resources & Data Access

- Public-use PISA 2022 (OECD) and TIMSS 2023 (IEA) files are freely available  
- Optional: use cloud computing for intense regression analysis  
- Power BI Desktop is free; organizational license may be required for sharing dashboards
